# developing_data_products_project
This my course project for Coursera Data Science Specialization course Developing Data Projects. I made a Shiny App (two files, ui.R and server.R) and a slidify presentation pitching my app.

Link to the app itself is here: https://zavolainen.shinyapps.io/deaths_in_Finland/.

My app is showing Deaths in Finland between years 1980-2017. It is based on data from Finnish public authority  'Statistics Finland which is specifically established for statistics. Original data can be found from here: http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/fi/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__kuol/statfin_kuol_pxt_002.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=c1bf6367-34a0-4cea-ae6a-464c464cb16c. My saved dataset is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zavolainen/developing_data_products_project/master/kuol_002_201700.csv.
