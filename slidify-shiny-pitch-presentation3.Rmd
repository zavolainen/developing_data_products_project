## 1

This my course project for Coursera Data Science Specialization course Developing Data Projects. I made a Shiny App (two files, ui.R and server.R) and a slidify presentation pitching my app. This is THE pitch.

So, to the point: people die around the world and Finland, my home country, is not an exception. Yearly amount of deaths in Finland have done up more than 20 percent between years 1980 and 2017. You don't believe? 

Check yourself from my interactive Shiny app: https://zavolainen.shinyapps.io/deaths_in_Finland/.

## Data Cleaning

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tibble)
library(varhandle)        

dataUrl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zavolainen/developing_data_products_project/master/kuol_002_201700.csv"
        deaths <- t(read.csv(dataUrl, stringsAsFactors=FALSE))
        colnames(deaths) <- deaths[1,]
        deaths <- deaths[2:nrow(deaths),]
        deaths <- rownames_to_column(as.data.frame(deaths), "Year")
        deaths <- as.data.frame(lapply(deaths, gsub, pattern='X', replacement=''))
        deaths <- unfactor(deaths)
        
        head(deaths)
        
```

## Background

App is based on data from Finnish public authority Statistics Finland which is specifically established for statistics. Original data can be found from here: http://pxnet2.stat.fi/PXWeb/pxweb/fi/StatFin/StatFin__vrm__kuol/statfin_kuol_pxt_002.px/table/tableViewLayout2/?rxid=c1bf6367-34a0-4cea-ae6a-464c464cb16c. 

My saved dataset is here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zavolainen/developing_data_products_project/master/kuol_002_201700.csv.
